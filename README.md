This project contains my very first attempts at writing code on Android.

It was my first 'larger' project, and the first one I ever used Git(Hub) with.
It is a mess of mainly functional, but overcomplicated or not even working code, but most of it does work.

I gained a lot of experience with Java, Android, Git and handling kind of large projects by doing this.
It may be updated from time to time, but is not in my main focus currently.



*Do me (and probably yourself) a favour and do __not__ read the comments and commit messages, most of them were written late at night, without me really thinking about it, resulting in.. weird stuff*
